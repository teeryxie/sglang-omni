"""Reusable pinned host staging buffers and device completion events.

Streaming decoders copy device results into pinned host memory asynchronously
and wait on a device event before reading them back. The two classes here hold
just the buffer and the event and carry no ownership policy: the owner
serializes access, grows a buffer only while no asynchronous copy can still be
using it, and must not touch a slot between ``record()`` and observed
completion (a successful ``synchronize()``, or a ``query()`` that reported
True).
